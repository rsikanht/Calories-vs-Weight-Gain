# From the provided data set, the correlation value is 0.95 where both variables are strong and positively correlated.
# Co-ef. are significant and co-ef.of Determination value. i.e R^2 is 0.90 which is good.
# Hence model is best fit and Calories consumes is an appropriate input to determine Weight Gain.
